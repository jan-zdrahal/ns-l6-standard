# Contribution Policy for the NS-L6 Standard

The NS-L6 Standard is a **custodially governed normative framework**.  
For this reason, **direct contributions (pull requests) are not accepted**.

This policy preserves:

- provenance integrity  
- authoritative authorship  
- determinism of normative content  
- auditability of revisions  

---

## 1. How to Propose a Change

If you believe the standard contains an error or could be clarified:

1. Open a GitHub Issue:  
   https://github.com/jan-zdrahal/ns-l6-standard/issues

2. Use the label:  
   `proposal`

3. Provide:
   - affected section(s)
   - proposed language or question
   - rationale

Your input will be reviewed as **non-normative feedback**.

---

## 2. What Cannot Be Proposed

The following cannot be changed through public proposals:

- responsibility invariants  
- axioms A1–A6  
- NI-1 … NI-14  
- layer definitions  
- time taxonomy  
- non-invertibility rules  
- provenance / TSA anchoring  
- authorship and custodianship  

These are foundational and not open to revision.

## 3. Pull Requests

**Pull requests will be closed automatically.**

Only the custodian (Jan Zdráhal) may modify normative content.

## 4. Style Notes (Non-normative)

If submitting clarifying feedback:

- be precise  
- avoid speculative theory  
- do not propose downward inference  
- respect formal terminology

## 5. Thank You

Thoughtful issues and analytical questions help strengthen the 
documentation around the NS-L6 Standard.
