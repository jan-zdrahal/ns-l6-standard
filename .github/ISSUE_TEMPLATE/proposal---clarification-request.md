### Submission Protocol
The NS-L6 Standard is a custodially governed normative framework. Please ensure your submission adheres to the following structural constraints:

* Proposals attempting to alter core Axioms (A1–A6), Normative Imperatives (NI-1…NI-14), Layer definitions (L0–L6), Time Taxonomy, or cross-layer non-invertibility rules will be automatically rejected.
* All input is processed strictly as **non-normative feedback**.
* Submissions must utilize formal terminology (e.g., Actor, State, Time Index) and avoid speculative theory.
